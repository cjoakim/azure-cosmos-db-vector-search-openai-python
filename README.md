# Azure Cosmos DB Vector Search with OpenAI API (Python)

This project showcases the fusion of Azure Cosmos DB with OpenAI's API,
enabling Python-driven vector-based search capabilities. By synergizing
the strengths of Azure Cosmos DB and OpenAI, you can establish a resilient
and effective system for performing sophisticated similarity searches within
your data. 

---

## Features

This repository also includes practical examples of Vector Search utilizing
three Azure Cosmos DB APIs and Python.

### Examples include 

- Wrangling raw CSV data into enhanced JSON documents with calculated and normalized values 
- Vectorizing data with Azure OpenAI
- Vector Searching this data with the Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore API
- Vector Searching this data with the Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL API, with Azure Cognitive Search
- Vector Searching this data with the Azure Cosmos DB PostgreSQL API, with the pgvector extension

## Primary Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Azure PaaS Services: OpenAI, Cosmos DB account(s), Cognitive Search
